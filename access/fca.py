    loc_index   : {bool, str}
                 is the the name of the df column that holds the facility locations.
                 If it is a bool, then the it the location is already on the index.
    loc_value   : str
                 If this value is `None`, a count will be used in place of a weight.
                 Use this, for instance, to count restaurants, instead of total doctors in a practice.
    cost_df    : `pandas.DataFrame <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_
                 This dataframe contains the precomputed costs from an origin/index location to destinations.

    cost_dest  : str
                 The name of the column name of the destination locations.
                 This is what will be _in_ each group.
    cost_cost  : str
                 This is is the name of the cost column.
    weight_fn  : function
                 This function will weight the value of resources/facilities,
                 as a function of the raw cost.
    max_cost   : float
