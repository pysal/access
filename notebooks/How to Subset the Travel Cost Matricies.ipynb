    "# How to Subset the Pre-Computed Travel Cost Matricies\n",
    "To calculate spatial access measures, data on travel times or distances between origins and destinations must be used. If you only need distances between origins and destinations, the `access` package will calculate Euclidean distances for your projected data. If you need travel times for a specific travel mode (walking, public transit, or driving) you need to generate these so-called travel time (or travel cost) matrices from other sources. We provide pre-calculated travel cost matricies between blocks and tracts [here](https://access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources.html) for the 20 largest cities in the US and for the entire country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset are point-to-point distance matrices generated by the Center for Spatial Data Science. The matrices come as bzipped CSVs. Cities are listed according to their containing county code. The origins for each distance matrix are the population-weighted centroids that lie within each county, and the destinations are any population-weighted centroids that lie within 100 km of the buffered county.\n",
    "\n",
